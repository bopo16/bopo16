👋 Hi, I’m Jack

⛏️ I'm a geoscientist from Australia, working mostly in geodata and geospatial applications.

👀 I’m interested in arty data visualisations, public transport maps, and ML applications in geology

🌱 Always learning something. I'm currently playing with [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) data, [isochrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map), and Azure. 

💞️ If you know of any good resources specific to geology and GIS, then hit me up!
