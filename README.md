👋 Hi, I’m Jack

⛏️ I'm a geologist from Australia

👀 I’m interested in data visualisation, GIS, and ML applications in geology

🌱 I’m currently learning... a lot. I'm new to programming, so I'm starting with Python and R

💞️ If you know of any good resources specific to geology and GIS, then hit me up!

📫 I can be reached on twitter @bopo16
