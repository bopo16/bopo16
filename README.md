👋 Hi, I’m Jack

⛏️ I'm a geologist from Australia

👀 I’m interested in data visualisation, GIS, and ML applications in geology

🌱 I’m currently learning... a lot. I'm still pretty new, so I'm learning [Python](https://github.com/csev/py4e), SQL, and following [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

💞️ If you know of any good resources specific to geology and GIS, then hit me up!

📫 I can be reached on twitter [@bopo16](https://twitter.com/bopo16)
