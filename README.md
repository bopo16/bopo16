👋 Hi, I’m Jack

⛏️ I'm a geoscientist from Australia, working as a geospatial analyst in natural disaster adaptation and mitigation.

👀 I’m enthusiastic about public transport, art/science data visualisation, and ML applications in geology. 

🌱 Always learning something. I'm currently playing with [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) data, [isochrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map), and ML aerial image interpretation.
